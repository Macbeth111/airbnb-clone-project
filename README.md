# Feature Breakdown

## 1. **User Management**
Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. This feature allows users to sign up as guests or hosts, securely log in, and manage their personal details, roles, and account settings.

## 2. **Property Management**
Enables hosts to create, update, and manage property listings. Hosts can upload property details such as descriptions, pricing, photos, and availability, which are then visible to guests browsing for accommodations.

## 3. **Booking System**
Allows guests to book available properties for specific dates. This system checks property availability, prevents double bookings, and records reservation details like duration, guest info, and total cost.

## 4. **Review System**
Lets users leave reviews and ratings after a stay. This feature builds trust on the platform by enabling guests to share their experiences and hosts to receive feedback on their property listings.

## 5. **Payment Integration**
Handles secure processing of payments related to bookings. Guests can make payments through third-party gateways (e.g., Stripe), and the system ensures proper association with the relevant booking and status tracking.

## 6. **Search and Filtering**
Supports searching for properties based on location, price range, date availability, and other filters. This improves user experience by helping guests find suitable properties quickly and efficiently.

## 7. **Authentication & Authorization**
Implements secure access control using JWT tokens or sessions. Ensures that users can only access and manage resources that belong to them (e.g., a host can only modify their own properties).

## 8. **Notifications (Optional Enhancement)**
Sends email or in-app notifications for key events like booking confirmations, cancellations, or new reviews. This feature helps keep users informed and engaged with the platform.

## 9. **Admin Panel (Optional Enhancement)**
Allows administrators to monitor and manage platform activity. Admins can manage users, moderate listings or reviews, and handle disputes or reported content.

# API Security

Security is a critical part of the backend architecture, especially for a platform that handles sensitive user data, financial transactions, and access to private resources. The following key measures will be implemented to ensure the security of the system:

## 1. **Authentication**
- **Method:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) will be used to verify user identity after login.
- **Purpose:** Ensures that only registered users can access protected routes. It secures user sessions and prevents unauthorized access to personal data.

## 2. **Authorization**
- **Method:** Role-based access control (RBAC) will be enforced.
- **Purpose:** Guarantees that only authorized users can perform specific actions (e.g., only hosts can create properties, only the booking owner can cancel a booking). This prevents privilege escalation and misuse of system functions.

## 3. **Data Validation and Sanitization**
- **Method:** Input validation libraries (e.g., Joi, Yup) and ORM-level constraints.
- **Purpose:** Prevents SQL injection, XSS, and malformed request payloads that could compromise the application.

## 4. **Rate Limiting**
- **Method:** Tools like `express-rate-limit` will be used to limit API request frequency.
- **Purpose:** Protects against brute-force attacks and API abuse by throttling repeated requests from the same IP or user.

## 5. **Encryption**
- **Method:** HTTPS with TLS for data in transit; password hashing with bcrypt.
- **Purpose:** Secures sensitive information like login credentials and payment data. Prevents interception or leakage of private user information.

## 6. **Payment Security**
- **Method:** Integration with trusted third-party services like Stripe or PayPal.
- **Purpose:** Delegates the handling of financial data to PCI-compliant providers, reducing risk and ensuring secure payment processing.

## 7. **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) Configuration**
- **Method:** Configured middleware to allow only trusted frontend origins.
- **Purpose:** Prevents unauthorized domains from making API requests, protecting users from CSRF and data leaks.

## 8. **Logging and Monitoring**
- **Method:** Security logging and anomaly detection tools (e.g., Winston, Sentry).
- **Purpose:** Detects unusual activity, failed login attempts, or system intrusions in real-time to enable rapid response.

## Why Security is Crucial

- **Protecting User Data:** Personal and contact information must be secured to prevent identity theft and breaches.
- **Securing Payments:** Financial transactions involve sensitive data; any compromise could lead to fraud or loss of trust.
- **Preserving Platform Integrity:** Unauthorized access or abuse can damage reputation and lead to legal issues.
- **Ensuring Trust:** Users are more likely to use and recommend a platform that prioritizes their safety and privacy.

# CI/CD Pipeline

## What is a CI/CD Pipeline?

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**. A CI/CD pipeline is an automated process that helps developers integrate code changes frequently, run automated tests, and deploy updates to production or staging environments reliably and efficiently. It ensures that code is always in a deployable state and reduces the risks associated with manual deployment.

## Importance for the Project

Implementing a CI/CD pipeline is crucial for:
- **Faster Development Cycles:** Automates testing and deployment, allowing quicker feedback and iteration.
- **Improved Code Quality:** Ensures all code changes are tested before being merged, reducing bugs in production.
- **Deployment Consistency:** Prevents human error by automating the deployment process, making releases predictable and repeatable.
- **Team Collaboration:** Encourages frequent integration, minimizing merge conflicts and integration issues.

## Recommended Tools

- **GitHub Actions:** Automates workflows for building, testing, and deploying the backend directly from GitHub repositories.
- **Docker:** Containers ensure the application runs consistently across all environments (development, staging, production).
- **Docker Compose:** Simplifies the setup of multi-container environments during local development or testing.
- **Heroku / Render / AWS ECS:** Platforms for deploying and hosting the backend services.
- **PostgreSQL Add-ons:** For managing cloud-based databases alongside your application deployment.
- **Supertest + Jest:** Used in the pipeline to run backend tests automatically on every push or pull request.

## Example Workflow

1. Developer pushes code to GitHub.
2. GitHub Actions triggers:
   - Linting and unit tests.
   - Integration tests using Docker containers.
   - Build and push Docker image.
3. If successful, the app is automatically deployed to the staging or production environment.

This ensures every update is thoroughly checked and delivered without manual intervention.
